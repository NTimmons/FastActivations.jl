# FastActivations.jl
A collection of activation function approximations for Flux.

In some models the accuracy of the `sigmoid` and `tanh` functions can be reduced without a loss of accuracy in the training process. Switching to an approximation can reduce training times significantly for some models. 

## Sigmoid Approximations
For `sigmoid` we provide fitted approximations using Taylor and Pade curve fit models as well as an implementation which uses a fast `exp` imeplemention based on an approximation of the formula: `exp(x) = lim`<sub>`n->inf`</sub> `(1 + x/n)`

### Theano Sigmoid

There is also an implementation of `TheanoFastSigmoid` which is currently accepted in the Theano project. It is here mostly for comparison because it is both slower and less accurate than other `Sigmoid` approximations.

## Tanh Approximations
For `tanh` we provide fitted approximations using Taylor and Pade curve fit models as well as an implementation based on the continuous fraction approximation of tanh.

 Additionally we also provide the `serpentine` function.
